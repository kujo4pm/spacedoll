		Thanks so much for completing this HIT! Your participation is a valuable contribution to our research.

		This study was about decision making. Some decisions are purely made from habit, whereas other decisions are the result of more deliberate planning. This task is designed to distinguish between these two types of decision making.

	<p>
		Using mathematical models, we can infer to what degree you used planning and habit during this task. We are testing whether habitual decision making is in part driven by the temptation of immediate reward.
